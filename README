"WikiLink" is a Vim plugin which eases the navigation between files 
 in a personnal wiki
 Links syntax currently supported follows Github's Gollum (https://github.com/github/gollum)
  [[My displayed link|My link]]

 This plugin also detects footerbar and sidebar files and splits the window accordingly (again, see Gollum for syntax)

 Installation
 ------------
 Copy the wikilink.vim file into the $HOME/.vim/plugin/ directory

 Usage
 -----
 Hit the ENTER key when the cursor is on a wiki link
 The corresponding file is loaded in the current buffer
